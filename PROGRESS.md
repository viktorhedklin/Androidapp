# Build Progress — Game Autopilot

Shared status log for this rebuild. Read this file first in any new
session before touching the repo. Full plan/rationale is at
`/root/.claude/plans/a-generic-no-root-android-purring-bee.md` (may not
be reachable from a different container — this file is the durable copy).

## Architecture (LLM-brain version, not JSON-rules)

The autopilot is an AI brain that watches the screen via MediaProjection
+ accessibility + ML Kit OCR, calls a cloud LLM (OpenAI-compatible:
OpenAI, NVIDIA NIM, any compatible vision model — or Google Gemini via
its own `generateContent` REST brain), and dispatches taps / swipes /
waits via accessibility gestures. A persistent overlay sits on top of
the running game with Start / Stop / Quit. Per-game knowledge lives in
each game's system prompt plus a small persistent per-game **memory**
(goal/progress notes the brain writes itself), stored in a small game
library.

User flow: open app → game library → tap "+" to add a game (pick app,
name, system prompt, tick rate) → Settings to set API key + model →
tap a game's "Launch & Autopilot" → permission check → overlay foreground
service starts → MediaProjection consent → game launches → tap Start in
the overlay → DecisionLoop runs: capture → think → act → wait.

## Push access note (2026-07-06)

Commits `3c9c1d1` (batch G, wip) and this Batch I commit are sitting on
the local branch `claude/android-game-autopilot-7mc6mx` **unpushed**.
`git push` fails with `Permission to viktorhedklin/Androidapp.git denied
to alpha666c` — the GitHub identity behind this session has read access
(fetch/branch-list work fine) but not write access. The repo owner needs
to grant `alpha666c` collaborator/write access (or fix the GitHub App
installation) before any further pushes can land. Diagnosed via direct
curl against the git relay (`127.0.0.1:41729`) and the GitHub MCP tools —
not a proxy glitch, a real permissions gap. Next session: check whether
push works now before assuming it's still blocked.

## Batch I — Gemini provider + persistent per-game memory (done)

**Gemini provider:**
- `brain/PromptBuilder.kt` (new) + `brain/BrainResponseParser.kt` (new) +
  `brain/CallAwait.kt` (new) — extracted the system/user prompt text and
  the strict-JSON response parsing out of `OpenAiCompatibleBrain` so both
  it and the new `GeminiBrain` share identical prompt/schema logic; only
  the HTTP envelope differs per provider.
- `brain/GeminiBrain.kt` (new) — calls Gemini's `generateContent` REST
  endpoint (`system_instruction` + `contents[].parts[]` with
  `inline_data` base64 image, `generationConfig.responseMimeType =
  "application/json"`), auth via `x-goog-api-key` header. Reports
  `promptFeedback.blockReason` in the exception when Gemini blocks a
  response instead of just failing opaquely.
- `data/Settings.kt` — `useNvidia: Boolean` replaced with
  `provider: BrainProvider` (`OPENAI`/`NVIDIA`/`GEMINI` enum) plus
  `defaultUrlFor`/`defaultModelFor` helpers. Default Gemini model is
  `gemini-3.5-flash` (GA as of mid-2026, vision-capable, supports
  Computer Use) — **not** `gemini-3.5-pro`, which per Google's own
  materials is scheduled to ship ~2026-07-17 and doesn't exist yet as an
  API model id. Once it (or any newer model) ships, just paste its model
  id into Settings → Model — no code change needed.
- `data/SettingsRepository.kt` — persists `provider` as a string enum
  name instead of the old boolean pref key.
- `ui/SettingsActivity.kt` + `res/layout/activity_settings.xml` — the
  provider toggle became a 3-way `RadioGroup` (OpenAI / NVIDIA NIM /
  Google Gemini) since a boolean switch no longer fits 3 options.
- `brain/BrainFactory.kt` — branches on `settings.provider`.

**Persistent per-game memory:**
- `brain/Brain.kt` — `BrainContext.gameMemory: String` (fed into the
  prompt each tick) and `BrainDecision.memoryUpdate: String?` (brain
  writes back an updated summary when something worth remembering
  happened — current goal, progress, what to try next).
- `data/GameMemoryStore.kt` (new) — one small text file per game at
  `filesDir/memory/{gameId}.txt`, capped at 4000 chars.
- `core/DecisionLoop.kt` — constructor gained `initialMemory` +
  `onMemoryUpdate`; keeps memory in a `@Volatile var`, includes it in
  every `BrainContext`, and calls back out when the brain updates it.
- `core/AutopilotController.kt` — loads memory from `GameMemoryStore` in
  `start()`, persists updates via the loop's callback (fire-and-forget
  `scope.launch`). Memory intentionally survives `stop()`/`quit()` — the
  whole point is that it persists across sessions.
- `ui/AddGameActivity.kt` + `activity_add_game.xml` — **Reset memory**
  button (visible only when editing an existing game), separate from
  **Delete**. Deleting a game also clears its memory file.
- `PromptBuilder.kt`'s system prompt documents the optional `"memory"`
  JSON field and instructs the brain to keep it under ~120 words and
  only update it when something changed.

## Batch G — in progress (paused before session limit)

Two new files are on disk and committed but **not yet wired in**:

- `core/A11yFastPath.kt` — cheap heuristic: after a successful TapMark
  the loop remembers the label; on subsequent ticks with the same
  label still visible AND small perceptual-hash delta, re-issues the
  tap without calling the brain. Capped at 3 consecutive fast-path
  ticks. Created but `DecisionLoop` does not call it yet.
- `overlay/DebugOverlayView.kt` — full-screen non-interactive View
  that draws current SoM mark boxes + highlights the last-tapped
  mark in red. Created but `OverlayService` does not add it to the
  WindowManager yet.

**To finish G in the next session:**

1. `core/AutopilotController.kt`: expose a `debugFrame: SharedFlow<DebugFrame>`
   (where `DebugFrame(marks, lastTappedMarkId)`) emitted from
   `buildSnapshot` / after each dispatch.
2. `overlay/OverlayService.kt`: when `Settings.showDebugOverlay` is on
   (new setting), add a second WindowManager view of type
   `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` with flags
   `FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE | FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE | FLAG_LAYOUT_NO_LIMITS`
   sized to MATCH_PARENT, hosting `DebugOverlayView`. Collect the
   debug flow into `view.update(...)`. Remove on quit.
3. `core/DecisionLoop.kt`: before calling `brain.decide`, ask the
   `A11yFastPath` instance (held in the loop) for a fast-path action
   list; if non-null, dispatch those and skip the brain call. On
   normal brain decisions, call `fastPath.recordBrainDispatch(...)`.
   Add fastPath as a constructor parameter.
4. `core/AutopilotController.start()`: instantiate `A11yFastPath()` and
   pass to DecisionLoop. Reset it in `quit()`.
5. `data/Settings` + `SettingsRepository` + `SettingsActivity` + layout
   + strings: add `showDebugOverlay: Boolean = false` and
   `useFastPath: Boolean = true` toggles.

## Batch H — still not started

Extract `ScreenReader`, `ActionExecutor`, `Reasoner` interfaces. The
existing classes become default impls. Lets us later add Shizuku
executor / on-device Gemini-Nano reasoner without touching the loop.

## Architecture upgrades landed in F

- **Set-of-marks prompting.** Each tick, `CandidateExtractor` builds up
  to 80 `MarkBox` candidates from (clickable a11y nodes ∪ OCR line
  boxes), de-duplicated by IoU > 0.6, sorted by area DESC. The
  screenshot sent to the brain has translucent numbered rectangles
  drawn on top by `SetOfMarksOverlay`. The brain's system prompt now
  strongly prefers `tapMark`/`longPressMark`/`typeText` over raw
  pixel coordinates — VLMs are much better at picking IDs than coords.
- **`Action.TypeText`** routed via
  `AutopilotAccessibilityService.typeOnFocused()` →
  `AccessibilityNodeInfo.ACTION_SET_TEXT` on the focused editable
  node, with optional `IME_ENTER` submit.
- **Stuck-state circuit breaker.** `DecisionLoop` tracks a 3-tick
  rolling buffer of `dHash` values (`util/PerceptualHash`). If all
  three are within Hamming distance 5, sets `BrainContext.stuckHint`
  so the brain knows to try a recovery action; trips into
  `LoopPhase.ERROR` after 6 consecutive stuck ticks.
- **Cycle log.** `core/CycleLog` writes one JSONL line per tick to
  `filesDir/cycles/YYYY-MM-DD.log` (timestamp, hash, delta, mark count,
  thought, action labels, dispatch results, foreground pkg). Auto-prunes
  after 7 days. Toggle in Settings.

Note: `core/Action.kt` was moved up from Batch C to Batch B because the
brain depends on it (`BrainDecision.actions: List<Action>`).

## Already pushed

- `c80a455` — Gradle/module scaffold: root + `app/build.gradle.kts`,
  `settings.gradle.kts`, `gradle.properties`, wrapper, `.gitignore`,
  `proguard-rules.pro`.
- `fe1da06` — `PROGRESS.md` shared cross-session build log.
- (this commit) — Batch A.

## Key decisions to preserve (don't regress these)

- Package/namespace: `com.gameautopilot.app`. minSdk 26, target/compile 34.
  AGP 8.5.2, Kotlin 1.9.24, JDK 17, Gradle wrapper 8.7.
- **No** `org.json` Gradle dependency — Android ships it natively.
- **No** `buildFeatures.viewBinding` — use `findViewById`.
- `DecisionLoop.tick()` must treat `Action.Wait(ms)` as additive delay
  for the *next* tick, not a no-op. This is the most important behavioral
  fix — verify by inspection in Batch C.
- ML Kit text-recognition only for OCR (no OpenCV).
- Brain is OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions with vision (image_url with
  base64 jpeg). Default model `gpt-4o-mini`. NVIDIA NIM works by setting
  base URL to `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` + a vision-capable
  model. Anthropic & Gemini explicitly out of scope for v1.
- Screenshot encoding: longest edge ≤ 1024px, JPEG q=80, base64.
- API key stored in plain SharedPreferences (`autopilot_settings.xml`,
  excluded from backups). Documented in README. "Clear API key" button
  in Settings.
- Safety: per-game `targetPackage` foreground check before dispatch,
  configurable max actions/minute (default 30), always-visible
  Stop/Quit in overlay.
- Target repo: `viktorhedklin/androidapp`, branch
  `claude/android-game-autopilot-7mc6mx`. `main` is fast-forwarded from
  this branch on demand. No PR opens unless user asks.
- This is a **rebuild from a textual handoff description**, not a restore
  of the original 2-commit history (`1bfc063`, `e8fa68a`) — that bundle
  is unreachable from this environment.

Note: after Batch A the project **will not compile yet** — the manifest
references classes (`App`, `MainActivity`, `ui.*`, `accessibility.*`,
`overlay.OverlayService`) that don't exist until Batches B–D. This is
intentional pacing; the next batch is meaningful work and the manifest
is locked in.
